# 🌟 Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 

Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

At the end of the course, these are my 🔑 **key learnings**:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data, and work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.
